# asdfcli

Very simple CLI tool to use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), written in Bash

## Why ?

I find `asdf` quite tedious to use.

Hence I wanted to make it a bit more interactive, using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

### Requested Binaries

- [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
